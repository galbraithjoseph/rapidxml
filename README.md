# rapidxml
RapidXML fork with `string_view`s and `xml_document` *move* and *append(move)* support. More or less extensive tests. Removed static buffer in memory pool.

Todo:
* Introduce `string_view` for the few cases that were overlooked.
* The whole code base needs some serious overhauling, it's a mess.
